This program makes a ternary tree out of text and then traverses them inorder, preorder, and postorder. 

- With 0 arguments [./P0], it will read from the keyboard, put the text into an output file, make a ternary tree
from said text, traverse it in those 3 ways, and output into output.inorder, output.preorder, and 
output.postorder. 

- With 1 argument [./P0 test], it will search for a file with the name 'test' with the extension ".sp2022"
at the end of it. It will read text from that file, make a ternary tree, traverse, and then output into
test.inorder, test.preorder, and test.postorder. 

- With 2 arguments [./P0 w text.sp2022], it will create a file (add to an existing one), make a ternary tree
from that text, and output in into output.inorder, output.preorder, and output.postorder.

- Invocation: 
    - [./P0] to input text from keyboard
    - [./P0 test] to read from 'input.sp2022'
    - [./P0 w text.sp2022] to write to 'text.sp2022' and output into output files
